# Foundational DevOps Concepts  
## What is DevOps?
DevOps combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and produce high-quality software consistently. It encourages teamwok between the operations and development teams.

## The core principles of DevOps include:
-	Cooperation among different groups 
-	Automation of workflows and repetitive tasks 
-	Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration (CI/CD) 
-	Feedback loops for ongoing improvement 
-	Uniform environments using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) 

## DevOps Lifecycle Stages 
- **Planning**: Use agile methods and collaboration to set project goals, specifications, and timelines. 
- **Development**: Apply coding best practices and version control systems when writing and managing code. 
- **Building**: Use automated build tools to compile code and create build artifacts. 
- **Testing**: Implement both automated and manual testing to confirm the security, functionality, and quality of the code. 
- **Release**: Tag versions and ensure builds are stable and compliant before deploying them to production. 
- **Deployment**: Move verified code into the production environment automatically or manually, minimizing downtime. 
- **Operations**: Manage configurations, services, and infrastructure to ensure system performance and reliability. 
- **Monitoring**: Continuously observe system performance and user experience, collecting data for proactive improvements. Monitoring â€“ Continuously observe system performance and user experience, collecting data for proactive improvements.
